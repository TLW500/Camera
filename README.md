# Camera
 Functionality
 I basically made an app and installed it to my android physically.This app just allows you to
 switch between taking a picture and recording videos via buttons. I’m able to have all the
 camera functions like flash and different filters for both image captures and video recordings

 Experience
 1. Technologies and Techniques:
 ● Understanding how to use Intents to launch the camera app for both image capture and
 video recording.
 ● Handling permissions requests and runtime permissions for accessing the camera and
 external storage.
 ● Utilizing the MediaStore API to interact with the device's media content provider for
 capturing media files.
 ● File management techniques for saving captured images and videos to the device's
 external storage.
 ● Utilizing layouts, views, and event handling in Android development to create a
 user-friendly interface.
 
 2. Coding Styles and Design Patterns:
 ● Following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) or MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
 architecture for better separation of concerns and maintainability.
 ● Employing Kotlin language features such as coroutines for asynchronous programming
 and extension functions for cleaner code.
 ● Applying SOLID principles and clean coding practices to write maintainable and scalable
 code.
 
 3. Challenges and Roadblocks:
 ● Understanding the complexities of handling camera operations and permissions on
 different Android versions and devices.
 ● Dealing with device-specific issues and differences in camera APIs and behavior.
 ● Ensuring proper error handling and user feedback for scenarios such as permission
 denial or camera not available.
 ● Managing file storage and handling large media files efficiently to prevent performance
 issues.
 
 4. Improvements for Starting Over:
 ● Conducting thorough research on best practices and common pitfalls related to camera
 and media handling in Android development.
 ● Breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and iterations to address
 challenges incrementally.
 ● Testing the app on a variety of devices and Android versions early in the development
 process to identify compatibility issues.
 ● Leveraging libraries or frameworks that provide abstractions and simplify camera and
 media handling tasks.
 ● Keeping the user experience (UX) in mind and iterating on the app's design based on
 user feedback and usability testing.
